#
#  This is a basic, generic find_package function intended to find
#  any package with the following conditions:
#
#  (1) The package has a CMake variable associated with it
#      that is a path directory pointing to the installation directory
#      of the package.  It is assumed that the libraries and include
#      files are either contiained within this directory or the
#      sub-directories lib/ or include/, respectively.
#
#  (2) The name(s) of the required library file(s) will be given to
#      the macro as a string list argument, and each will be tested in 
#      sequence.
#
#  (3) The name(s) of the required include file(s) will be given to 
#      the macro as a string list argument, and each will be tested in 
#      sequence.
#
#  (4) For a package with associated environment variable VAR, this
#      macro will define the variables:
#
#        VAR_FOUND - Boolean indicating if all files/libraries were found
#        VAR_INCLUDE_DIRS - Directory path(s) to include files
#        VAR_LIBRARIES - Full path(s) to each libraries
